                    <p class="imaging-text">We will collaborate with you and your insurance company to help you efficiently manage your healthcare resources.  We are committed to providing the best treatment for our patients and we charge what is usual and customary for our area.  We encourage clients to clarify their benefit information prior to beginning any treatment so that you understand what portion of services will be covered by insurance and what portion will be paid privately.  We accept most insurance plans.  Our services are generally eligible for FSA and HSA reimbursement.  If you are unsure about whether your insurance plan covers please call us.  Our staff is more than willing to assist you. Please keep in mind that all charges are the responsibility of the patient regardless of your insurance coverage. We will be happy to file claims with your insurance carrier.  Full payment for deductibles and copays are due at the time of service. We accept cash, checks, and major credit cards.
